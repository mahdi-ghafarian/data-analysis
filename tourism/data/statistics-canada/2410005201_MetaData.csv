1,"Throughout the existence of the Tourism Statistics Program, Statistics Canada introduced changes to improve the quality of its data (for example, a new data source, a new estimation method). For further information on the methodology used by Frontier Counts or the changes implemented over time, users are advised to consult the <a href="https://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p2SV.pl?Function=getSurvey&SDDS=5005" rel="external noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Frontier Counts (opens new window)</a> pages."
2,"Vehicles plated in countries other than the United States of America or Canada, and military or diplomatic vehicles are excluded from this table."
3,"Length of stay for vehicles is no longer published, as the data were mostly imputed and it is not a well-established tourism concept. Users can access the historical breakdowns of length of stay for vehicles from 1972 to 2021 in archived table 24-10-0002-01."
4,"As of January 2022, the maximum number of passengers allowed in an automobile before it is considered a bus is 8, in order to align with UN Tourism recommendations. Prior to 2022, the maximum was 10."
5,"Prior to 2022, the series for motorcycles also contained other land vehicles (for example, bicycles, snowmobiles, ATV). As of January 2022, there are separate series for motorcycles and other land vehicles."
6,"Other land vehicles include bicycles, snowmobiles, ATV, et cetera. They do not include buses or trains."
7,"As of January 2022, all ferry travellers are included in the water mode, in order to align with UN Tourism recommendations. Prior to 2022, most of these travellers were included in the land mode as either pedestrian or automobile travellers (the only exception was Fortune, in Newfoundland and Labrador)."
8,"Prior to 2022, an "other land vehicle" was reclassified as an automobile if there were more than 4 passengers and as a bus if there were more than 10 passengers. As of January 2022, it is no longer reclassified based on the number of passengers."
