1,"Throughout the existence of the Tourism Statistics Program, Statistics Canada introduced changes to improve the quality of its data (for example, a new data source, a new estimation method). For further information on the methodology used by Frontier Counts or the changes implemented over time, users are advised to consult the <a href="https://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p2SV.pl?Function=getSurvey&SDDS=5005" rel="external noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Frontier Counts (opens new window)</a> pages."
2,"As of January 2022, one passenger from each bus record is considered a crew member. Prior to 2022, there were no crew from bus travellers."
3,"In this table, "commercial aircraft" includes cargo aircrafts."
4,"As of January 2022, all ferry travellers are included in the water mode, in order to align with UN Tourism recommendations. Prior to 2022, most of these travellers were included in the land mode as either pedestrian or automobile travellers (the only exception was Fortune, in Newfoundland and Labrador)."
5,"As of January 2022, the maximum number of passengers allowed in an automobile before it is considered a bus is 8, in order to align with UN Tourism recommendations. Prior to 2022, the maximum was 10."
6,"Prior to 2022, the series for motorcycles also contained other land vehicles (for example, bicycles, snowmobiles, ATV). As of January 2022, there are separate series for motorcycles and other land vehicles."
7,"In this table, "cruise ship or other commercial boat" includes cargo ships."
8,"Prior to 2022, all residents of countries other than the United States of America entering by air or water were considered tourists (overnight visitors). As of January 2022, if these travellers are recorded as same-day, they will be published as excursionists."
9,"As of January 2022, non-resident travellers with a trip duration of 365 days or more are considered as "other travellers" (not as visitors). Prior to 2022, they were reclassified as Canadian-resident visitors."
10,"Prior to 2022, all Canadian residents returning from countries other than the United States of America were considered tourists (overnight visitors). As of January 2022, if these travellers are recorded as same-day, they will be published as excursionists."
11,"Prior to 2017, vehicle type for residents of countries other than the United States of America entering by land was not available. Starting in 2017, it was available for only one data source. As of January 2022, it is available for all data sources."
12,"In this table, "other non-tourism related purposes" includes work, immigration, military service, diplomats or members of consular staff."
13,"Prior to 2022, crew residing in countries other than the United States of America entering by land were considered tourists (overnight visitors). As of January 2022, they are considered as crew ("other travellers")."
14,"As of January 2022, travellers from Primary Inspection Kiosks (PIK) who declare their purpose of trip as work are classified as "other travellers" (not as visitors),  in order to align with UN Tourism recommendations. Prior to 2022, they were considered as visitors."
15,"Prior to 2022, an "other land vehicle" was reclassified as an automobile if there were more than 4 passengers and as a bus if there were more than 10 passengers. As of January 2022, it is no longer reclassified based on the number of passengers."
16,"Prior to 2022, land immigration data from the Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada were added as “other travellers”. As of January 2022, as data from the Canada Border Services Agency already include persons immigrating to Canada by land (although they are not indicated specifically as immigrants), in order to avoid overestimating the number of arrivals in Canada, only data from CBSA is retained and those travellers are counted as visitors by default."
