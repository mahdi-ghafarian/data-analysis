"Note ID",Note
1,"Comparisons of historical Visitor Travel Survey (VTS) results and current VTS results must be done with caution due to the use of different methods to produce estimates. Data from 2018 to the first quarter of 2020 were produced using a combination of the Air Exit Survey (AES), record imputation and invitation cards. Data from the second quarter of 2020 to the fourth quarter of 2022 were produced using a model based on 2019 VTS estimates adjusted with Frontier Counts benchmarks, and alternate data. Starting with the first quarter of 2023, data are produced for visitors entering Canada by air using the AES and for visitors entering Canada by modes other than commercial air using a model based on historical visitor survey data from 2013 to 2019. This data is adjusted using Frontier Counts and by comparing historical AES results with current AES results."
2,"Quality indicators can only be calculated using survey data and are therefore available for the time periods prior to the pandemic (Q1 2020 and earlier) for all modes of entry and for the time periods starting in Q1 2023 for entry by air commercial only. Between Q2 2020 and Q4 2022, no data quality indicators could be produced since there was no collection. Estimates based on fewer than five Visitor Travel Survey records (for Q1 2020 and earlier) or fewer than five Air Exit Survey records (for Q1 2023 onward) were suppressed from this table and replaced with a quality indicator of F, and estimates based on between five and nine records were assigned a data quality indicator of E. For Q1 2023 onward, if an air commercial estimate was suppressed, the non-air commercial and total estimates for the same domain were also suppressed."
3,"Province-visits are not relevant at the national level, and are therefore omitted in this table."
4,"Non-resident visitors residing in a country other than the United States of America are also referred to as overseas visitors."
5,"Within the same trip, visits to the same geography are only counted once. For example, a trip with a visit of one night to Ontario, followed by a visit of two nights to Alberta, and then a visit of five nights to Ontario are counted as two separate visits: one visit to Ontario with six nights and one visit to Alberta with two nights. "
7,"Expenditures do not include commercial fares to travel between countries."
8,"For 2018 and 2019, total spending differs from total spending reported by category because U.S.-resident excursionists (same-day travellers) entering Canada by car were only asked for their total spending."
9,"Starting with the release of the second quarter 2024, the methodology for modelling visits and expenditures at the provincial/territorial level for US same-day trips where travelers entered Canada via a mode other than commercial air has been improved to better reflect the expected location where these travelers were visiting. The impacted final estimates have been revised starting with the first quarter of 2023. Estimates that focus on trips by residents of countries other than the United States of America or with entries to Canada via commercial air were unaffected."
10,"The calculation of nights per visit includes same-day visits (zero nights)."
